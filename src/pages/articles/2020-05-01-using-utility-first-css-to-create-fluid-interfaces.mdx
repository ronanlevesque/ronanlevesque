Itâ€™s been only a few days since I [last wrote](/articles/react-and-atomic-css/) about the power of Atomic / Utility-first CSS, but there is plenty left to say about that methodology and its popularity. Frameworks based on it have been widly adopted: Tailwind has [22.2k](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) stars on GitHub, while Tachyons is close to [10k](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/) stars. New technologies have emerged: Atomic CSS-in-JS seems to be a thing now with libraries such as [Styletron](https://github.com/styletron/styletron), [cxs](https://github.com/cxs-css/cxs/) or [Fela](https://github.com/robinweser/fela).

However, despite the maturity of the concept, I feel like there are a few blank spaces left around it. One of them is what I call fluid user inferfaces.
