Since Iâ€™m mostly working from home, having the right computer setup is critical for my productivity and my well-being. I recently bought a [curved ultra wide monitor](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/monitors/mateview-gt/) and I find it to be a better option than two screens, or a a wide monitor + laptop. The huge space easily allows for rearranging windows, splitting the screen in multiple ways, and so on.

I had multiple goals in mind when I started working on my home setup:

- Take advantage of this screen
- Keep my current desk configuration (mouse, keyboard, webcam, stereo sound) as-is.
