I used to write a lot of articles on front-end development back in the days (some of them are still available in the French archive section of my [articles](/articles)). The thing is, writing requires a lot of time and good discipline. Adding 2 kids in the mix kind of broke that dynamic, and I ended up completely removing my blog section when I migrated over to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) last year.

At that time, I moved my website from French to English, and from `.fr` to `.com` in order to go _international_. It didnâ€™t make much sense to keep a French-only part dedicated only to blogging, and that didnâ€™t really encourage me to go back to writingâ€¦

But when I reflect back on the 2Â¾ very busy years Iâ€™ve been working at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com), I realize I have missed plenty of opportunities to share the things Iâ€™ve learned working with such amazing tools as React, Gatsby or GraphQL.

During that period, my team and I were able to:

- Write a CSS atomic framework from scratch (before we decided to turn it into a [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) plugin, which is still a work in progress)
- Build a whole Design system, which is currently used on [www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com) and [blog.algolia.com](https://blog.algolia.com), amongst others
- Move over [www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com) from [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) to Gatsby
- Move over [blog.algolia.com](https://blog.algolia.com) from [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) to Gatsby
- And a lot of other stuff!

All those experiences came with tons of learnings that I would like to share more broadly now that Iâ€™ve managed to get this blog back to life. My old articles were mostly focused on CSS, HTML and responsive design, but now that I spend most of my days writing JavaScript, the content will evolve: expect way more topics around that!

Iâ€™ve also recently moved to an Engineering Manager position, and I might share some insights and learnings if I consider them to be relevant.

Thatâ€™s all, stay tuned ðŸ˜Ž
